## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** Interesting enough but, I sometimes have an hard time with the manipulation of XML files for the UI.

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** The `ArrayAdapter` can convert an `ArrayList` into a `ListView`. An advantage of this Adapter is that it is more efficient memory wise. The only rows kept in memory are the visible ones.

## Notes

Working of `Intent` wasn't obvious at first.
